## Work Experiences

### Instructor at Coding Minds

I have been teaching at [Coding Minds](https://codingmindsacademy.com/) since October of 2021 and have taught for 300+ hours. Subjects I have taught include Java, Python, Flutter, Unity, Construct 3, and HTML/JavaScript. Some of my responsibilities include preparing class material ahead of time, pacing my lessons with the students' pace, and distributing homework tailored to the students' needs.

### Researcher at Cal Poly Pomona

I was part of the [NSF REU Big Data Privacy and Security Program](https://www.cpp.edu/bigdatasec-reu/index.shtml) and engaged in researching the effects of perturbing image textures on object detection models, specifically Faster-RCNN. My responsibilities included writing the code for taking pictures of 3D objects using virtual camera, perturbing the image textures, and inputting them into Faster-RCNN to test its accuracy.

## Projects

### Research Papers

I have collaborated with some programmers to write research papers for mobile device applications and Unity games. One paper studies the effectiveness of a newly developed [to-do list app]() that can cleverly create tasks based on keywords and another paper studies an [innovative mobile health app]() that is designed to have those with mental health issues communicate with one another. One was sent to the 

### VR Game

I have developed a VR Game in Unity with three other friends, and it is a tower defense game that involves spawning troops and shooting guns to attack. A video demo can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6a3Kjr523JI), and some examples of C# scripts used can be found [here](https://github.com/DoozyKiddo/Ryan-VR-Scripts).

## Passions

### Music

I like to make music in LMMS in my free time. A couple of recent tunes that I am proud of are [Sticky Showdown in a White World](https://soundcloud.com/user-131478155/sticky-showdown-in-a-white-world) and [Plummeting Leaves](https://soundcloud.com/user-131478155/plummeting-leaves). You can find the rest of my music [here](https://soundcloud.com/user-131478155).

### Video Editing

I also enjoy creating videos and posting them on YouTube. The vast majority of the videos on my channel are related to video games. My most recent video can be seen [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3uuh2KRoeQ&ab_channel=DoozyKiddo).
