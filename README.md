## Welcome to My Website!

I am currently a third-year computer science major at Cal Poly Pomona who wishes to pursue a career in software engineering.

Here are some of my passions:

### Music

I like to make music through LMMS in my free time. A couple of recent tunes that I am proud of are [Sticky Showdown in a White World]https://soundcloud.com/user-131478155/sticky-showdown-in-a-white-world and [Plummeting Leaves]https://soundcloud.com/user-131478155/plummeting-leaves. You can find the rest of my music [here]https://soundcloud.com/user-131478155.

### Video Editing

I also enjoy creating videos and posting them on YouTube. My most recent video can be seen [here]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3uuh2KRoeQ&ab_channel=DoozyKiddo.
